Part A:

$jellyfish count -m 21 -C -s 1000000 /Users/cmdb/qbb2020-answers/week_1_homework/Question2/*.fq
$jellyfish histo mer_counts.jf > reads.histo
    
    answer: there are 1091 kmers that occur 50 times  
    
Part B:

    $jellyfish dump -c mer_counts.jf > dumped_kmers.fa
    $sort -k 2 -n dumped_kmers.fa> sorted_dumped_kmers.fa 
    $head sorted_dumped_kmers.fa > top_10_most_frequent_kmers.txt
    
Part C: 

#import .hist file into genomescope 

MIN GENOME HAPLOID LENGTH = 233,468 bp

Part D: 

The GenomeScope size estimate of 233,468 bp is very close to the reference genome which was 233,806 bp - only about 350 basepairs short!
